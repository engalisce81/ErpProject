ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system is an integrated solution designed to manage business operations such as sales, inventory, human resources, accounting, and production. The goal of this system is to improve efficiency and reduce costs by integrating all these departments into a single platform.The system was developed using ASP.NET Core MVC with Async for performance improvement, Entity Framework for database access, Fluent API for data validation, and LINQ for flexible and efficient querying of data. Additionally, Identity, Roles, and Permission-based Authorization were implemented to ensure secure and role-specific access control, allowing users to have different levels of access based on their assigned permissions. Dependency Injection was utilized to improve code maintainability and manage dependencies efficiently, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture.
